# Programmation Concurrentielle et Interfaces Interactives-Mini Project

# Project Overview
This project develops a game inspired by "Flappy Bird" using Object-Oriented Java programming language. It is part of a course on Concurrent Programming and Interactive Interfaces in the third year of Computer Science Bachelor's Degree, aimed at familiarizing students with the key elements of the subject.

## Objective
Control a bird represented by an oval shape and navigate it along a generated line while avoiding leaving the line. Players can make the bird jump by clicking on the screen, but it will fall down by itself. The player's score is based on the journey's length and will be displayed at the end of the game using JOptionPane class. 

## Key Features
- Graphical interface 
- Oval representation of the bird 
- Jump and mouse event management 
- Flight simulation 
- Flight path point generation 
- Line advancement 
- Collision detection 
- Message box displaying player's score 
- Dynamic bird image 
- Dynamic cloud simulation using Perlin noise
